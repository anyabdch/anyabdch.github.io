<h3>Fun Facts</h3>
<ul id="funFacts"> 
    <li>I'm originally from Santa Monica, CA</li> 
    <li>I play water polo and I love backcountry hiking, leisure
        swimming, a good book, and travelling on budget airlines.</li> 
    <li>I have an unhealthy obsession with the New York Times 
        crosswords (mini and regular, all the days of the week for 
        those keeping score). My fastest mini time is 6 second!. </li> 
    <li>I don't eat fried food because when I was in the 8th grade my dad
         bet me I couldn't go 2 weeks. It's been 8 years.</li>
    <li>I'm bilingual! I grew up speaking Spanish, and I'm proficient in 
        Italian and French. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Academic Background</h3>
<p>
    My first quarter at Northwestern I took the introductory CS class in Python to fulfill a general 
    elective. I fell in love with programming and knew that I had found my path. 
    By the end of my first month I had declared as a CS major and by the end of my first year I had a job TAing for 
    the department. Programming had become my favorite passtime--it was a creative outlet for puzzling, problem solving, and innovation.
    I took classes in various languages (including Python, C, and C++) that explored data structures and
    algorithms, web development, mathematical theory in CS, and more. During my second year 
    at Northwestern, I decided to put my CS education on hold to finish a Bachelor's of Science in Social Policy and Education with a focus 
    on human development--how our identities, motivations, and socializations form and evolve over our lifetimes. I knew I wanted
    to be in the CS field career-wise, but I felt that understanding human development was key to seeing where in the field to focus. Throughout this time, I
    continued to work in the CS deparment as a teaching assistant, and began work as an Ethics Coordinator bringing conversations on tech ethics into the 
    introductory CS courses. I am now pursuing a master's in Computer Science to deepen my passion into a thorough mastery across a well-rounded variety of topics in the field.
     Academically, my primary interest lies at the intersection of Computer Science and Human Development--human-computer interaction and accessible design. My bachelor's not being a traditional degree 
     associated with CS has given me a unique academic perspective for understanding the field and its implications for society. My background in social 
     development, identity, and interaction now functions as the framework through which I study Computer Science. I’ve gained the tools to explore how 
     these factors apply to the impact and uses of technology for diverse groups of people. 

</p>
<h3>Career Goals</h3>
<p>
    I hope to further apply my education to a career in user-centered software engineering. I'm building a deeper understanding 
    of how to identify and create technology that fosters productivity, collective action, and social good. As I enter the workforce, I'm seeking companies and organizations
    that reflect these values, and are ethically creating technology that isn’t driven by addiction, convenience, and consumption.
