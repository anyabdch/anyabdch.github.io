            <h3>The Fun Stuff</h3>
            <p> 
                I'm a sophomore at Northwestern University studying Computer Science and Human Development.
                But I'm getting ahead of myself! I'm originally from Santa Monica, CA. I play water polo
                and I love hiking, swimming, a good book, and travel. I'm bilingual! I'm fluent in Spanish,
                and proficient in Italian and French. Before coming to college, I devoted a large portion of 
                my time to community service projects. I've worked on and ran various endeavors including
                asylum case interpretation, COVID-19 grocery deliveries, access to feminine hygiene products
                at my high school, and more.

            <h3>My CS Background</h3>
            <p>
                My first quarter at Northwestern I took the introductory CS class in Python. I fell in love with
                the subject and knew that I had found my path. By the end of my first month I had declared as a
                CS major, and by the end of my first year I had a job TAing for the department. Programming has
                become my favorite passtime and the perfect fuel for my curiosity. I've taken classes
                in various languages, including Python, C, and C++, as well as in exploring data structures and
                algorithms, web development, and mathematical theory in CS. In my (limited) free time, I've been
                teaching myself Django, Flask, and other frameworks to build personal projects such as the ones
                back on the home page. To date Python remains my favorite language, but I'm also enjoying exploring
                front-end endeavors (such as this one!)

            <h3>My Aspirations</h3>
            <p>
                Community service is still incredibly important to me. At the start of my sophomore year I declared a second major 
                in Human Development. These classes have helped me gain a more nuanced perspective of the world around me 
                and understand where work is needed. As I build my CS skills, I'm always thinking
                about how I can use them to help the people around me. I'm currently developing an app to help local 
                cafes and residents work together to reduce food waste and food injustice in Evanston. My goal, when 
                I graduate, is to work in a setting where what I produce goes to efforts towards social justice, community 
                service, and bettering the world we live in.
